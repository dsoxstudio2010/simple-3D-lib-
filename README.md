this is a simple minimal 3D library that can currently display notable objects,
unfortunately it didn't compile and I gave it to a neural network that fixed everything
and in the end I just did control + c, control + v,
it works directly with X11 and accordingly will only work on Linux distributions and most likely freeBSD,
I made it out of boredom
